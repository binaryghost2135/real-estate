## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated indigo (#4F46E5) for a sense of trust and modernity.
- Background color: Light gray (#F9FAFB), close in hue to the primary, providing a clean and neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: A softer analogous blue (#70A5FF) to complement the primary indigo and create visual interest.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, for a modern and clean user interface.
- Use consistent, modern-style icons (like Heroicons or Font Awesome) for property details (bedrooms, bathrooms, area).
- Employ a grid-based layout for property listings to ensure a clean, organized, and responsive design.
- Subtle fade-in animations for content loading and transitions to improve the user experience.
